# About the Ecotone Wiki

The Ecotone wiki was an online community formed between 2003 and 2005 where over 50 bloggers gathered to discuss their interests in place and blogging. The site utilized social networking software and it aimed to encourage participants to forge a deeper sense of place. Its core activity included posting bi-weekly topics, which acted as heuristic devices to stimulate invention, leading to the production of over 300 posts on various topics during its two years of activity.
